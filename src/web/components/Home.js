        MedChat is a platform to allow emergency responders to share their stories and pictures with the world. What else to we love besides a good story? Good food! So if you don't have a story, post your recipe. Create your account with your email and password and then post your content at the welcome page. The Top Stories section shows all user submitted data in order of popularity (upvotes). User data (text body, account info, media) is stored on our Firebase server.
