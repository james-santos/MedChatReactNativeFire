/* that did help a lot thanks! but ultimately the issue was converting it to a request that firebase could understand. I had to do an old school
urlToBlob = url => {
   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
     xhr.onerror = reject;
     xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
       if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
         resolve(xhr.response);
       }
     };
     xhr.open("GET", url);
     xhr.responseType = "blob"; // convert type
     xhr.send();
   });
 };
